Tactile VR Doom Demo
===================

*Tactile VR Doom* is a tech demonstration that illustrates the possibilities of using the physical world to modify the VR world. This is accomplished by utilizing the back-facing camera on the phone while using Google Cardboard (a Virtual Reality viewer)

What Does This Demo Show?
-------------

The demonstration provided is focused around the weapon-aiming mechanism. The weapon (a handgun) in-game is fired once every two seconds to demonstrate the aiming mechanism and it's potential accuracy


 How To View The Demo
-------------
 

To use this demonstration you will require two things: Firefox on Android and green stickers on a toy gun. 

Due to limitations in mobile web browsers, most browsers do not support having the camera initialized while in VR mode. However, thanks to Firefox this is a possibility. For best results use Firefox Beta for Android. You will also ned the *Mozilla WebVR Plus* extension for the mobile browser to enable VR mode. When you are asked for which camera to use (when you start up the demo) choose the rear-facing camera.

The stickers are easy. Green stickers from 'for sale' price-tags is what I used. However, the tolerance of color is so wide that any green will do. Slap these stickers on a toy gun (at the nozzle and the eyesight) and you are set
